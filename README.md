Complete a full play analysis for the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play from scratch using publicly available data.

Rough outline/stage gates:

Phase 1: Bubble map
Goal create a production bubble map for the Wolfcamp.
Data needed

~ Production data (3, 12, 24 month cumulative production)

	~ Oil

	~ Water

	~ Gas
~ Well design data

	~ Lateral length
	
	~ Lat long

Phase 2: Top picker/Target ID

Phase 3: Structure maps

Phase 4: Well Target ID

Phase 5: EUR forecasting (?)

Phase 6: Well log analysis

Phase 7: Volumetric/Geologic maps 

Phase 8: Well performance prediction

Phase 9: Cost assumptions (?)

Phase 10: Value maps (?)

Phase 11: Spacing impacts (?)

Phase 12: Development plans/sticks (?)
