This is an admittedly ambitious project and will likely take quite a while.

Goal:
Complete a general play analysis for the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play from scratch using publicly available data.

Current projects:

P1: Field production trends (time based, location based?)
Goal: Recreate this image (https://twitter.com/ShaleProfile/status/1158352308385792000)
Current issues: Where can I find lat longs for leases?


P2: Production Bubble map
Goal: Create a production bubble map for the Wolfcamp.
Current issues:  Need to decide on allocation assumptions (produciton reported at lease level not well level)

Future ideas:
Top picker/Target ID
Structure maps
Well Target ID
EUR forecasting (?)
Well log analysis
Volumetric/Geologic maps 
Well performance prediction
Cost assumptions (?)
Value maps (?)
Spacing impacts (?)
Development plans/sticks (?)
